%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   Secondary pore network design optimization analytical diffusion model for lithium ion battery

Secondary pore network design optimization analytical diffusion model for lithium ion battery
is a MATLAB application that quantifies the impact of SPN on ionic diffusion
with a composite electrode through a simple analytical approach, considering
various pore channel geometries and comparing to standard electrodes with
identical gravimetric and identical volumetric specific theoretical capacity.
